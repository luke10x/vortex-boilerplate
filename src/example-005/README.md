Example with Two models (Monkey and Gizmo) 
==========================================

Same as 004 but with also loads shows Gizmo.

Gizmo and Monkey head use their own shaders.
Also, note that Gizmo uses Immediate Mode Rendering,
and the Monkey Head uses Indexed Rendering with EBO.

Monkey and Gizmo separated to their own structures.
