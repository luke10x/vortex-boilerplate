Example with Assimp basic loading
=================================

Same as 003 but with Assimp

Model is loaded, monkey head monkey added.
It uses mesh colors, no textures,
and only ambient and diffuse ligting.

Light position hardcoded.

Assimp does not load normal from .blend,
only from .glb.

Assimp generation of normals is glitchy and
provides less control on what normals I want to use.
